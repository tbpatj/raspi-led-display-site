preset navigation will go as follows

when you click to edit a device, you can modify the current settings, if a preset is selected and you modify the "preset" settings it will go to custom-(device-name) preset, and you can just auto configure from there. If they want to save it as a preset, they can override a preset by naming it the same thing as a preset already created, or by saving the preset with a name it will become a new preset
